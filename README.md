# Clinic-System

This is mainly an object oriented project.
Here I have build a clinic system, where I have decided to put 5 specialists.

So whenever a patient arrives, he/she can simply take a token from the
machine that will print a token for him/her for the particular specialist they want.
The system will ask some information about the patient such as their ID, Name, Gender , Age
and contact number.

It is basically a walkin chinic so it only books appointment for a day and the next day it resets.
So for intance if the specialist is already booked at that time then it the system
will show that the specialist is not available at that time and ask to book another
appointment at a different time.
